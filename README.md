# web_geojson

### Setup
 -- install flutter
 -- `flutter pub get`
 -- `flutter run  -d web`

## Getting Started

This project is an example project to show the geojson package not functioning correctly in web, or to learn what I'm doing wrong.

The page should update with the number of geojson features, but doesn't.
